The State of Charge is an important index in the Battery management system,
as it supervises charging and discharging indices which help in the longevity and
performance of the batteries. There is no perfect definition of SOC, precisely can be
defined as the ratio of the total available capacity of the battery to its maximum
possible charge that can be stored in the battery. This can be implemented in many
ways for example the inclusion of microcontroller units and artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence(AI) is the replication of human intelligence in machines that
mimics and performs actions similar to human actions. Artificial Intelligence is
widely used in battery management systems. Precisely, Neural network models are
trained to predict the future SOC. 

Furthermore, accurate SOC prediction is possible
with high-performance calculations and big data for Deep Learning algorithms
incorporated with Battery management systems.

we proposed a possible solution for estimating SOC through
Deep learning algorithms with the help of Real-Driving Cycles so that Electric
Vehicle drivers can foresee their journey.
